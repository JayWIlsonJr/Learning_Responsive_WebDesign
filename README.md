Project created while studying responsive design. There are 3 breakpoints (1024px wide, 481px-1023px wide, and 480px wide or less) to cover desktops, tablets, and cellphone. 

The design responds to the size of the device that it is being viewed on and alters the layout of the site on the fly. Which version of the site is displayed depends on what the width of the devices screen.
